# What is ROS CMakeLists.txt
### Offcial web:http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt

## 1. Overview

CMakeLists.txt is the input to the CMake build system to describe how to build the code and where to install it.

## 2. Overall Structure and Ordering

Your CMakeLists.txt file MUST follow this format otherwise your packages will not build correctly. The order in the configuration DOES count.

1. Required CMake Version (cmake_minimum_required)

2. Package Name (project())

3. Find other CMake/Catkin packages needed for build (find_package())

4. Enable Python module support (catkin_python_setup())

5. Message/Service/Action Generators (add_message_files(), add_service_files(), add_action_files())

6. Invoke message/service/action generation (generate_messages())

7. Specify package build info export (catkin_package())

8. Libraries/Executables to build (add_library()/add_executable()/target_link_libraries())

9. Tests to build (catkin_add_gtest())

10. Install rules (install())

## 3. CMake Version

Every catkin CMakeLists.txt file must start with the required version of CMake needed. Catkin requires version

2.8.3 or higher.

## 4. Package name

Be specified by the CMake *project()* function. Name the package as "robot_brain" by using:

> project(robot_brain)

And you can reference the project name by using variable ${PROJECT_NAME} wherever needed in CMake script.

## 5. Finding Dependent CMake Package

We need to specify which other CMake package that need to be found to build our project using the CMake *find_package()* function. And there is always at least one dependecy on catkin:

> find_package(catkin REQUIRED)

If your project depends on other packages, you can specify them as compents of catkin instead of using two find_package function.

>find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS nodelet)

**The runtime dependencies**should not be added into the components, which only includes what you need to build
your project.

### 5.1 What Does find_package() Do?

If package is found by CMake through find_package, it results in the creation CMake environment variables that give infomation about the found package.

### 5.2 Why are catkin packages specified as components?

Catkin package is not really components of catkin. But if you use the components of catkin, the find_package will create environment variables with *caktkin_* prefix. It is recommended.

### 5.3 Boost

If using C++ and Boost, you need to invoke find_package() on Boost and specify which aspects of Boost you are using as components. For example, if you wanted to use Boost threads, you would say:

> find_package(Boost REQUAIRED COMPONENTS thread)

## 6. catkin_package()

*catkin_package()* is a catkin-provided CMake macro. This is required to specify catkin-specific information to the build system which in turn is used to generate pkg-config and CMake files.

This function **must be called before** declaring any targets with *add_excutable()* or *add_library()*. The function has 5 optional arguments:

> INCLUDE_DIRS - The exported include paths(i.e.cflags) for the package
> LIBRARIES - The exported libraries from the project
> CAKTIN_DEPENDS - Other catkin projects that this project depends on.
> DEPENDS - Non-catkin CMake projects that this project depends on.
> CFG_EXTRAS - Additional configuration options

Full macro docs can be found in https://docs.ros.org/groovy/api/catkin/html/dev_guide/generated_cmake_api.html#catkin-package

As an example:

>catkin_package(
>   INCLUDE_DIRS include
>   LIBRARIES ${PROJECT_NAME}
>   CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp nodelet
>   DEPENDS eigen opencv)

This means that the folder "include" within the package folder is where exported headers go. The CMake environment varialbles ${PROJECT_NAME} evaluates to whatever you passes to the *project()* function earlier. "roscpp"+"nodelet" are packages that need to be present to build/run this package, and "eigen"+"opencv" are system dependencies that need to be present to build/run this package.

## 7. Specifying Build Targets

Build targets can take many forms, but they reperent one of two possibilites:

> Excutable Target - programs we can run
> Library Target - libraries can be used by excutable targets at build and /or runtime

### 7.1 Target Naming

It is very important to note that the names of build targets in catkin **must be unique regardless of the folders they are built/installed to**. One can have a target renamed to something else using the *set_target_properties()* function:

> set_target_properties(rviz_image_view
>   PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME image_view
>   PREFIX "")

This will change the name of rviz_image_view to image_view in the build and install outputs.

### 7.2 Custom output directory

While the default output directory for executables and libraries is usual set to a reasonable value it must be customized in certain cases. I.e. a library containing Python bindings must be placed in a different folder to be importable in Python:

> set_target_properties(python_module_library PROPERTIES LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX}/${CATKIN_PACKAGE_PYTHON_DESTINATION})

### 7.3 Include Paths and Library Paths

Prior to specifying targets, you need to specify where resources can be found for said targets, specifically header files and libraries:

> Include Paths - Where can header files be found for the code (most common in C/C++) being built
> Library Paths - Where are libraries located that executable target build against?
> include_directories(<dir1>, <dir2>, ..., <dirN>)
> link_directories(<dir1>, <dir2>, ..., <dirN>)

#### 7.3.1 include_directories()

The argument to include_directories should be the *_INCLUDE_DIRS variables generated by your find_package calls and any additional directories that need to be included. If you are using catkin and Boost, your include_directories() call should look like:

>include_directories(include ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})

The first argument "include" indicates that the include/ directory within the package is also part of the path.

#### 7.3.2 link_directories()

The CMake link_directories() function can be used to add additional library paths, however, this is not recommended. All catkin and CMake packages automatically have their link information added when they are find_packaged. Simply link against the libraries in target_link_libraries()

> link_directories(~/my_libs)

### 7.4 Excutable Targets

To specify an executable target that must be built, we must use the *add_executable()* CMake function.

> add_executable(myProgram src/main.cpp src/some_file.cpp src/another_file.cpp)

This will build a target executable called *myProgram* which is built from 3 source files: src/main.cpp, src/some_file.cpp and src/another_file.cpp.

### 7.5 Library Targets

The *add_library()* CMake function is used to specify libraries to build. By default catkin builds shared libraries.

> add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} ${${PROJECT_NAME}_SRCS})

### 7.6 target_link_libraries

Use the target_link_libraries() function to specify which libraries an executable target links against. This is done typically after an add_executable() call. Add ${catkin_LIBRARIES} if ros is not found.

Syntax:

> target_link_libraries(<executableTargetName>, <lib1>, <lib2>, ... <libN>)

Example:

> add_executable(foo src/foo.cpp)
> add_library(moo src/moo.cpp)
> target_link_libraries(foo moo)  -- This links foo against libmoo.so

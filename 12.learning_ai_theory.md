# Basics

## visual turing test

不光是对图像中物体的识别，还包括了对图像中物体和物体之间的关系的识别

chinese room实验：像是理解了，但不是真正的理解--真正的思考

## Foundations of AI:
- Philosopy, Mathematics, Economics, Neuroscience, Psychology, Computer engineering, Control theory and cybernetics, Linguistics

Mathematics:
- logic, what are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
- Computation, what can be computed? --NP-completeness
- Probability, how do we reason with uncertain information? --Bayes' rules

Neuroscience
- How do brains process information? Prediction and simulation

Cognitive Psychology
- How do humans think and act? 
- mental processes: attation, memory, perception, language, metacognition

Control theory and cybernetics
- How can artifacts operate under their own control?

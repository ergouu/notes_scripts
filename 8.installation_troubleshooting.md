#Using mit-racecare code 

#https://github.com/mit-racecar

#to get the install script

#I install the ros-melodic desktop by source ,so the catkin_dir is ~/ros_melodic_ws

$ git clone https://github.com/jetsonhacks/installRACECAR.git


#get into the workspace

$ cd installRACECAR

#becasuse I use the bionic instead of kinetic ,so I have to change the install script as follows

$ vi installRACECAR.sh

#Then replace the line "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" with the path where you installed your ros workspace ,what is ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash for me


#run the installation

$ ./installRACECAR.sh

#!!when to catkin_make the code there are some error as follows

#so I deciede to make the code manually

#first to set the make enverinment

$ source ~/ros_melodic_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash

#run catkin_make

$catkin_make config --cmake-args -DCUDA_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME=OFF

#the following are make errors

1' processing catkin package:'ackermann_cmd_mux' could not find ackermann_msgs

To solve this ,I insert a line "add_dependencies(${PROJECT_NAME}_nodelet ackermann_msgs_gencpp)" into the CMakeLists.txt and it go through.

2' processing 'vesc_ackermann' ,the same error goes out,


#!!!!The previous method doesn't work but if use this command to catking_make can solve #those two problems, then I set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to go through thoese

#Finally, I understand that what caused the error is that I install the ros-desktop by source but install the ackermann_msgs by apt-get

$ catkin_make config --cmake-args -DCUDA_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME=OFF -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/ros/melodic/


#Then I get another error which is can find a package configuration file provided by "ZED"

#the ZED_SDK must be installed

$ wget THE_SDK_DOWNLOAD_URL

$ ./XXXX.run


#and then the opencv is not compatible , I think it is because the installRACECAR.sh use #the MIT-racecar install file "racecar.rosinstall" contains a outdate version of the zed_wrapper , so we can git clone the lastest version of the zed_wrapper to solve this #error

$ cd /workspce/racecar-ws/src

$ git clone https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper.git

$ cd zed-ros-wrapper

$ mv zed_wrapper ..

$ cd ..

$ mv zed-ros-wrapper ..

#then the problem solved, and other packages are needed by the zed_wrapper, we can follow the hint to fix it.




#Atfter finished, Let's test it by manual control

$ cd /workspace/racecar-ws

$ source devel/setup.bash

$ roslauch racecar teletop.lauch

#If there is an error like "VESC Serial open failed:Permission denied" ,should change the #access permisson of the device

$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyACM0
#To set the default permission of the device by adding MODE="0666" into /etc/udev/rules.d/#XXX.rules


#insert "source /workspace/racecar-ws/devel/setup.bash" into ~/.bashrc , then you can #excute this command in anydirection

$ roslauch racecar teleop.lauch


#Pass! It works.

# What does tf do?

A robotic system typically has many 3D coordinate frames that change over time, such as a world frame, base frame, gripper frame, head frame, etc. tf keeps track of all these frames over time, and allows you to ask questions like:

> Where was the head frame relative to the world frame, 5s ago?
> What is the pose of the object in my gripper relative to my base?
> What is the current pose of the base frame in the map frame?

There is no center server of transform information.

# How to Listening for transforms

This is the code :

--------------------

#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <tf2_ros/transform_listener.h> //The tf2 packge provides an implementation of a TransformListener to help make the task of receiving transforms easier.
#include <geometry_msgs/TransformStamped.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/Twist.h>
#include <turtlesim/Spawn.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
ros::init(argc, argv, "my_tf2_listener");

ros::NodeHandle node;

ros::service::waitForService("spawn");
ros::ServiceClient spawner =
node.serviceClient<turtlesim::Spawn>("spawn");
turtlesim::Spawn turtle;
turtle.request.x = 4;
turtle.request.y = 2;
turtle.request.theta = 0;
turtle.request.name = "turtle2";
spawner.call(turtle);

ros::Publisher turtle_vel =
node.advertise<geometry_msgs::Twist>("turtle2/cmd_vel", 10);

tf2_ros::Buffer tfBuffer; //Here,we create a TransformListener object.
tf2_ros::TransformListener tfListener(tfBuffer);//Once the Listenser is created ,it starts receiving tf2 transformations over the wire, and buffer them for up to 10s.

ros::Rate rate(10.0);
while (node.ok()){
geometry_msgs::TransformStamped transformStamped;
try{
transformStamped = tfBuffer.lookupTransform("turtle2", "turtle1",
ros::Time(0));
/*Here, the real work is done. The arguments of lookupTransform() is ,we want the transform to target frame("turtle2") * *from source frame("trutle1"), the time at which we want to transform by providing *ros::Time(0)* ,and the Duration *before timeout, which is optional , default=ros::Duration(0.0).
*/
}
catch (tf2::TransformException &ex) {
ROS_WARN("%s",ex.what());
ros::Duration(1.0).sleep();
continue;
}

geometry_msgs::Twist vel_msg;

vel_msg.angular.z = 4.0 * atan2(transformStamped.transform.translation.y,
transformStamped.transform.translation.x);
vel_msg.linear.x = 0.5 * sqrt(pow(transformStamped.transform.translation.x, 2) +
pow(transformStamped.transform.translation.y, 2));
turtle_vel.publish(vel_msg);

rate.sleep();
}
return 0;

# How to add a frame

## 1. Why adding frames

For many tasks it is easier to think inside a local frame. tf2 allows you to define a local frame for each sensor ,link, etc in your system. And tf2 will take care of all the extra frame transforms that are introduced.

## 2. Where to add frames

tf2 builds up a tree structure of frames, which means it does not allow a closed loop in the frame structure. So a frame only has one single parent, but it can have several children. If we want to add a frame to tf2, one of the tree existing frames needs to be the parent frame and the new one would be a child frame.

## 3. How to add a frame

This is the code:

---------------
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <tf2_ros/transform_broadcaster.h>
#include <tf2/LinearMath/Quaternion.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
ros::init(argc, argv, "my_tf2_broadcaster");
ros::NodeHandle node;

tf2_ros::TransformBroadcaster tfb;
geometry_msgs::TransformStamped transformStamped;


transformStamped.header.frame_id = "turtle1";
transformStamped.child_frame_id = "carrot1";
transformStamped.transform.translation.x = 0.0;
transformStamped.transform.translation.y = 2.0;//The carrot1 frame is 2 meters offset from the turtle1 frame
transformStamped.transform.translation.z = 0.0;
tf2::Quaternion q;
q.setRPY(0, 0, 0);//To get quaternion value by Euler angle
transformStamped.transform.rotation.x = q.x();
transformStamped.transform.rotation.y = q.y();
transformStamped.transform.rotation.z = q.z();
transformStamped.transform.rotation.w = q.w();

ros::Rate rate(10.0);
while (node.ok()){
transformStamped.header.stamp = ros::Time::now();
tfb.sendTransform(transformStamped);
rate.sleep();
printf("sending\n");
}

};
